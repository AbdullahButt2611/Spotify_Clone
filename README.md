### Features
<br>
Following are some of the new features and learning encountered while creating this amazing project:

- A music streaming and recommendation system, which allows users to search for and listen to music, and receive personalized music recommendations.

- A web or mobile application for users to interact with the service, which has been designed with a user-friendly interface.

- A payment system for users to subscribe to the service or purchase individual songs or albums.

- A system for managing and organizing music and user data, such as playlists.

- To run the code, you will need to have Node.js, MongoDB and React.js installed on your machine, and configure the database connection settings in the code. Additionally, you will have to setup the music streaming and recommendation system with proper licensing agreements. Feel free to use and modify the code for your own projects or improvements.

### Advancement

> Creating a Spotify clone would require a significant amount of development resources and expertise in areas such as music streaming and recommendation systems, user interface design, and payment processing. It would also require obtaining the necessary legal rights to the music and meta-data.
